# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: December 2024**

## Overview

Linera Poker is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains what information we collect and how we use it.

## Information We Collect

### On-Chain Data

By design, Linera Poker stores minimal data on-chain:

- **Table Chain**: Game state, pot amounts, community cards, betting history
- **Player Chain**: Your hole cards (private to your chain), bet amounts, token balances

**Important**: Your hole cards are stored ONLY on your personal chain. The dealer chain and other players CANNOT access this data due to Linera's cross-chain architecture.

### Off-Chain Data

Our frontend application may collect:

- **Local Storage**: UI preferences, session state
- **Logs**: Error logs for debugging (anonymized)

We do NOT collect:

- Personal identification information
- IP addresses
- Email addresses
- Wallet addresses for tracking purposes

## How We Use Information

- **Gameplay**: To facilitate poker games between players
- **Improvement**: Anonymized data to improve the Service
- **Security**: To detect and prevent abuse

## Data Sharing

We do not sell, trade, or rent your information to third parties.

On-chain data is inherently public on the respective chains, but Linera's architecture ensures your private cards remain private.

## Security

- Smart contracts are open source and auditable
- Cross-chain privacy is enforced by protocol design
- No centralized database of user information exists

## Your Rights

- **Access**: All on-chain data is publicly verifiable
- **Deletion**: On-chain data is immutable; local data can be cleared
- **Portability**: You own your wallet and can export your data

## Cookies

The frontend uses local storage for session management. No third-party tracking cookies are used.

## Children's Privacy

The Service is not intended for users under 18 years of age.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page.

*Your cards are on YOUR chain. Privacy by architecture, not by promise.*
