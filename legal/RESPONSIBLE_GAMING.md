# Responsible Gaming Policy

**Last Updated: December 2024**

## Our Commitment

Linera Poker is committed to promoting responsible gaming. While our platform offers entertainment through poker games, we recognize that gambling can become problematic for some individuals.

## Know the Risks

Before playing, please understand:

- **Poker involves financial risk**: You can lose the tokens you stake
- **The house edge**: Rake is taken from pots to sustain the platform
- **No guaranteed wins**: Past performance does not predict future results
- **Skill vs. Luck**: While poker involves skill, luck plays a significant role

## Guidelines for Responsible Play

### Set Limits

- Decide on a budget BEFORE you play
- Never stake more than you can afford to lose
- Set time limits for your gaming sessions
- Take regular breaks

### Warning Signs

Seek help if you:

- Chase losses by betting more
- Borrow money to gamble
- Neglect responsibilities due to gambling
- Feel anxious or depressed about gambling
- Lie about your gambling habits
- Gamble to escape problems

### Self-Exclusion

If you need to take a break:

- Simply stop using the application
- We do not have account-based tracking, so you control your own participation
